USER STORIES (revised)


1. As a regular user, I want this app to remember my preferences, like noodles, pizza, steak, etc., so that I don¡¯t have to type in again and again.

2. As an adventurist for food, I want to see new and random restaurants I never knew, so that I¡¯m not stuck in my regular restaurants. 

3. As a food seeker, I want to be able to furtherly specify my preferences (vegan/vegetarian, food type) when I feel like so, so that the app¡¯s recommendations can fit me better by showing those restaurants more frequently.

4. As a chooser, I always want two restaurants to pop up at the same time, so that it¡¯s easier to make decisions. 

5. As a student, I want to know each restaurant¡¯s picture and average price, so that I can avoid overly expensive restaurants. 

6. As a hungry user, I want to know each restaurant¡¯s open time, so that I won¡¯t go there just to find that it¡¯s closed.

7. As a walker/driver, I want to know the distance from my location to the restaurant, so that I know whether it¡¯s convenient to go.

8. As a lazy person, I just want someone recommend to me a restaurant that¡¯s cheap and close to me so I don¡¯t have to do any search myself.
